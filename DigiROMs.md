DigiROMs are text representations of the data that is directly transmitted between devices during a V-Pet communication. Though there is variation between device types, these codes typically contain data for which Digimon, its power level, the course of the battle, and the victor.

Conventional DigiROMs display data in an unprotected format.

DigiROMs are used with Alpha programs (Alpha Serial, Alpha Terminal) and -Com hardware (A-Com, D-Com, F-Com).


Here are some of the DigiROMs I've manually collected.
